`Art-Ping` is a user-friendly, real-time checking engine to enable employees’ presence 
control during work hours in the modern world where the ability of distant work is getting
more and more popular and in high demand.

Why `Art-Ping`?
I want a tool that allows me to:
* automate the process of checking those of my employees who work on a distant base
* minimize the risk of distant employees’ productivity slowdown
* reduce the time spent by Project and Office Managers on checking the employees’ availability
* initialize manual and auto checks of a concrete employee or the office/project staff as a team
* analyze weekly and monthly results


You can run the application from the project root:
``` bash 
$ docker-compose up –d 
```
To avoid getting errors like `unexpected character`, use the command:
``` bash 
$ docker-compose disable-v2
```
